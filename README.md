# Bide Server

## Issues

- No typing for the frontend because this is a REST API and not GraphQL
- No authentication or authorization; Just a completely public API
- Database does not store actual user login information or anything
  - This means email and password
- Want to use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with different providers
